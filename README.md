# Nintendo WFCemu
Two emulators for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DSi browsers

Emulators Include :

Chip-8 *now to be WFChip-8

CoolNES made by GenericHeroGuy *now to be WFCoolNES

Note *right now no public releases exist yet for this experiment, as I have to recode the controls and try to lower the mb of these emulators.
 also no garentee this will work, but this project is at least a shot.


thanks *oxiti8* and *GenericHeroGuy*
